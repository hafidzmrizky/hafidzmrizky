# **Who is Hafidz?** 🤫
He is currently a **Vocational High School Student** in his **final year** before going to university. He has been traversing the world of technology since a young age, starting from a simple WordPress blog to a much-sophisticated product, even though most of his work isn't in the public repository yet. I believe he is quite active on his LinkedIn, or hunting the picture of a lifetime using his "borrowed" camera.
